# Risk Management

*At least* once each week, the project manager should update this document according to the instructions that follow. Update more frequently when appropriate.

## Risk assessment

Review the list below and enter "Yes" or "No" to indicate which categories have acceptable levels of risk.

|     Risk category     |     Is the category at risk?      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| investing too many or too few resources             |  Yes |
| missing success-critical stakeholders               |  No  |
| missing win conditions                              |  No  |
| conflicting win conditions                          |  No  |
| too much or too little quality assurance work       |  No  |
| too much or too little requirements definition      | Yes  |
| too much or too little design definition            | Yes  |
| too much or too little implementation work          | Yes  |
| too much or too little deployment planning          | Yes  |
| deploying too late or too soon                      |  No  |

## Risk mitigation

Add a row below the headings of the following table (so that the most recent information is at the top). In the new row, record the date, and *brief* plans to mitigate the most critical risk(s). 

Mitigation plans are steps that *you* will take *this week*, and probably today. Some examples:

- Assign staff to improve requirements documentation
- Continue implementing service X
- Place implementation tasks on hold
- Propose cancelling the project

The most critical risk(s) are the first appearance(s) of "Yes" in the table above. 

|  Date | Mitigation plans |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| 11/7  | Start defining Rev 1.1. |
| 11/7  | If someone is available for work, use them |
| 11/7  | Outline deployment phases to describe how we go from barebone to full App |
